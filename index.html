        <p>QUEENS, NY – Woodside residents are pushing back on what could be a lengthy battle with luxury real estate developers in their neighborhood.</p>

        <p>Last year, Madison Capital Realty began leasing at Woodside Central, a 478-unit, two story tower <a href="https://qns.com/2023/05/madison-realty-capital-opens-leasing-for-two-tower-development-at-woodside-central/">on 69th and 70th streets</a> in Woodside. But advocates worry this will increase the surrounding area’s rent and cost of living expenses.</p> 

        <p>Based on available listings on the <a href="https://www.woodside-central.com/">Woodside Central website,</a> the median rent for a 2-bedroom unit in the luxury building is over 40% higher than the <a href="https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/woodside-sunnyside">median rent for a similar sized unit in the neighborhood.</a></p>
        <br>

        <br>



        <p>Maria Seguera is one Woodside resident that is concerned about looming rent hikes and its impacts.</p>

        <p>“My income as a home attendant is extremely limited and it barely allows me to survive with the high cost of living,” <a href="https://rentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-06-12-RGB-Queens-Hearing-Transcript.pdf">said Maria Seguera,</a> a single mother of two daughters, at a city rent guidelines board meeting earlier this June. </p>

        <p>“It’s very sad and embarrassing to come here every year in front of you guys and beg for something that’s our right.” </p>
